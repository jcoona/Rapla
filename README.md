Faster Resource Search by Adam Claxton and Connor Jackson

Check out the powerpoint in rapla/Enhancement Artifacts to see a nice example of how to use our enhancement effectively!

All classes that we have added are in the following path:
org.rapla.gui.internal.edit.fields

They include:
ResourceDropBox
SearchController
SearchResource
SearchTextField

Our enhancement mostly makes the built in filter feature much more effective than before.
It uses a JComboBox, which allows users to choose a resource to search by.
And it uses a JTextfield, which allows the user to type in search criteria.
It's much more friendly in supporting users who wish to search by all resoure types, and search by just one resource.
It allows the previous filter feature to still exist, incase the user wishes to use it.

But really, check out our presentation. Our enhancement is extremely visual and the powerpoint will aide as a good guide.
